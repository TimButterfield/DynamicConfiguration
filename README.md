DynamicConfiguration
====================

Dynamic Configuration is a framework to enable access to configuration settings without having to create matching configuration types

===========================================================================================================================================

No doubt you've worked with the appsettings, or ConnectionStrings sections of a web.config/app.config before, and maybe you've had to go through the process of creating a custom configuration section. I find that although creating a configuration section gives you static typing, the overhead, is in my opinion a trade off. 

I've gone about therefore creating a framework that relies on dynamics to avoid having to create a configuration section for everything that is configurable, thus making it much easier to access configuration items.

At present there are no examples but some will follow shortly.
